== Important

It's advisable to be used as the last step in a CI/CD pipeline. Currently supports only 'free style project' but can be integrated in a groovy pipeline script just by using a build action , for example : 

    stage("Aggregate Report") {	
      build job: 'My_aggregate_results_job'
    }

Requires both global and job configuration.

* **Jenkins Account Username** : username of the account that will be used to access Jenkins API and fetch job results.
* **Jenkins Account password** : password of the account that will be used to access Jenkins API and fetch job results.
* **Mail Notification From** : sender for the mail Notification. Default is "Jenkins".
